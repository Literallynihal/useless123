# [ClockBuster] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Code Crusaders]

### Project Description
[ClockBuster is a whimsical and modern web application that redefines timekeeping by making it intentionally unreliable and fun. It's for those who feel that traditional clocks are just too predictable.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In today's fast-paced world, timekeeping has become painfully predictable. You set an alarm, it rings on time. A minute is always 60 seconds. It's reliable, yes, but where's the suspense? Where's the chaos?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[ClockBuster is the antidote to temporal monotony. It's a suite of time-related tools that work, but with a twist. Our Unreliable Alarm keeps you on your toes, the Warped Timer plays with your perception of time, and our Fictional World Clock lets you track time in places you can only dream of.]
